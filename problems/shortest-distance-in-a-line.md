#### Approach: Using `ABS()` and `MIN()` functions [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Calculate the distances between each two points first, and then display the minimum one.

**Algorithm**

To get the distances of each two points, we need to join this table with itself and use `ABS()` function since the distance is nonnegative.
One trick here is to add the condition in the join to avoid calculating the distance between a point with itself.

```sql
SELECT
    p1.x, p2.x, ABS(p1.x - p2.x) AS distance
FROM
    point p1
        JOIN
    point p2 ON p1.x != p2.x
;
```
>Note: The columns p1.x, p2.x are only for demonstrating purpose, so they are not actually needed in the end.

Taking the sample data for example, the output would be as below.
```
| x  | x  | distance |
|----|----|----------|
| 0  | -1 | 1        |
| 2  | -1 | 3        |
| -1 | 0  | 1        |
| 2  | 0  | 2        |
| -1 | 2  | 3        |
| 0  | 2  | 2        |
```

At last, use `MIN()` to select the smallest value in the *distance* column.

**MySQL**

```sql
SELECT
    MIN(ABS(p1.x - p2.x)) AS shortest
FROM
    point p1
        JOIN
    point p2 ON p1.x != p2.x
;
```
