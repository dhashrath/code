#### Car Fleet

```java
class Solution {
    public int carFleet(int target, int[] position, int[] speed) {
        int N = position.length;
        Car[] cars = new Car[N];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
            cars[i] = new Car(position[i], (double) (target - position[i]) / speed[i]);
        Arrays.sort(cars, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a.position, b.position));

        int ans = 0, t = N;
        while (--t > 0) {
            if (cars[t].time < cars[t-1].time) ans++; //if cars[t] arrives sooner, it can't be caught
            else cars[t-1] = cars[t]; //else, cars[t-1] arrives at same time as cars[t]
        }

        return ans + (t == 0 ? 1 : 0); //lone car is fleet (if it exists)
    }
}

class Car {
    int position;
    double time;
    Car(int p, double t) {
        position = p;
        time = t;
    }
}```


```python
class Solution(object):
    def carFleet(self, target, position, speed):
        cars = sorted(zip(position, speed))
        times = [float(target - p) / s for p, s in cars]
        ans = 0
        while len(times) > 1:
            lead = times.pop()
            if lead < times[-1]: ans += 1  # if lead arrives sooner, it can't be caught
            else: times[-1] = lead # else, fleet arrives at later time 'lead'

        return ans + bool(times) # remaining car is fleet (if it exists)```
