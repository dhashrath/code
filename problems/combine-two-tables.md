#### Approach: Using `outer join` [Accepted]

**Algorithm**

Since the *PersonId* in table **Address** is the foreign key of table **Person**, we can join this two table to get the address information of a person.

Considering there might not be an address information for every person, we should use `outer join` instead of the default `inner join`.

**MySQL**

```sql
select FirstName, LastName, City, State
from Person left join Address
on Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
;
```
>Note: Using `where` clause to filter the records will fail if there is no address information for a person because it will not display the name information.
