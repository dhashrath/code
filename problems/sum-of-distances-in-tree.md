#### Approach #1: Subtree Sum and Count [Accepted]

**Intuition**

Let `ans` be the returned answer, so that in particular `ans[x]` be the answer for node `x`.

Naively, finding each `ans[x]` would take $$O(N)$$ time  (where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the graph), which is too slow.  This is the motivation to find out how `ans[x]` and `ans[y]` are related, so that we cut down on repeated work.

Let's investigate the answers of neighboring nodes $$x$$ and $$y$$.  In particular, say $$xy$$ is an edge of the graph, that if cut would form two trees $$X$$ (containing $$x$$) and $$Y$$ (containing $$y$$).

Then, as illustrated in the diagram, the answer for $$x$$ in the entire tree, is the answer of $$x$$ on $$X$$ `"x@X"`, plus the answer of $$y$$ on $$Y$$ `"y@Y"`, plus the number of nodes in $$Y$$ `"#(Y)"`.  The last part `"#(Y)"` is specifically because for any node `z in Y`, `dist(x, z) = dist(y, z) + 1`.

By similar reasoning, the answer for $$y$$ in the entire tree is `ans[y] = x@X + y@Y + #(X)`.  Hence, for neighboring nodes $$x$$ and $$y$$, `ans[x] - ans[y] = #(Y) - #(X)`.

**Algorithm**

Root the tree.  For each node, consider the subtree $$S_{\text{node}}$$ of that node plus all descendants.  Let `count[node]` be the number of nodes in $$S_{\text{node}}$$, and `stsum[node]` ("subtree sum") be the sum of the distances from `node` to the nodes in $$S_{\text{node}}$$.

We can calculate `count` and `stsum` using a post-order traversal, where on exiting some `node`, the `count` and `stsum` of all descendants of this node is correct, and we now calculate `count[node] += count[child]` and `stsum[node] += stsum[child] + count[child]`.

This will give us the right answer for the `root`: `ans[root] = stsum[root]`.

Now, to use the insight explained previously: if we have a node `parent` and it's child `child`, then these are neighboring nodes, and so `ans[child] = ans[parent] - count[child] + (N - count[child])`.  This is because there are `count[child]` nodes that are `1` easier to get to from `child` than `parent`, and `N-count[child]` nodes that are `1` harder to get to from `child` than `parent`.

Using a second, pre-order traversal, we can update our answer in linear time for all of our nodes.


```java
public class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2)
            return nums.length;
        int[] up = new int[nums.length];
        int[] down = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    up[i] = Math.max(up[i],down[j] + 1);
                } else if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                    down[i] = Math.max(down[i],up[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return 1 + Math.max(down[nums.length - 1], up[nums.length - 1]);
    }
}```


**Complexity Analysis**

* Time Complexity:  $$O(N)$$, where $$N$$ is the number of nodes in the graph.

* Space Complexity:  $$O(N)$$.
